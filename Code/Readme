1) change the PATH variable to wherever the data is stored and make sure there are no other files in the folder. Not even readme or anything 
2) In Ubuntu press ctrl+alt+F4 . Login and cd to the place of project.py
3) run pypy project.py ( might have to install pypy) 
4) 3 files would be generated - 
Result - containing all the outputs
Degree - degrees of all the indices
Cluster - This was more for self reference contains clustering coefficient values for all 
5) To map the data back to the graph one can think of traversing the 63*63 matrix row by row . starting from the left most and moving to the rightmost. This is given that how was the data was stored in the files in the first place

6) To calculate the data with a lag i.e. a step of 2,3,4 weeks use project1.py 
7) Initialise the lag variable to 1,2,3,4  and the code takes care of the rest.
